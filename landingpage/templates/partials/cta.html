            Great reviews mean more revenue for companies. Employees are missing out on that value.<br>

            With ImpactCount, you can own and leverage every positive client review and team endorsement.
            And don't worry about your employer â€“ when they sign up and verify your employment,
            your positive impact will be showcased on their page too.<br>

            P.S. As AI will play a bigger role in HR and recruitment,
            having a strong online presence with positive performance
            can set you apart from the competition.
