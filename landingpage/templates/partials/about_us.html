                For companies, positive client reviews specifically mean more revenue. ImpactCount aims to give a bit of that power back to employees—enabling them to collect, own, and leverage their positive feedback and endorsements to their advantage, gathered directly from clients and colleagues.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                We want to validate whether enabling employees to control and own their positive reviews and endorsements can create a win-win situation, bringing more meaning and motivation. Companies do earn more with positive client reviews, but this value has been relatively locked away from the people who often make this happen — the employees.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                If this idea has any merit and gains traction, expanding into online recruitment and talent management could be a possibility.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                What if there is traction, but another company executes it better? Then, employees/workers will still benefit. There are many SaaS and HR tech models that could be reimagined with this more equitable approach.
