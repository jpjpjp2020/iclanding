                For companies, positive client reviews specifically mean more revenue.
                ImpactCount aims to give a bit of that power rightly back to employees - to collect, own, and leverage their positive feedback and endorsements to their advantage, collected directly from clients and colleagues.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                We want to validate if employees controlling and owning their positive reviews and endorsements can create a win-win situation with better relationships, more meaning and motivation, and a more equal power dynamic on the job. Companies do earn more with positive reviews, but this value has been relatively locked away from the people who actually generate this extra revenue - the employees.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                How can such a ridiculous business plan generate any revenue?
                The plan is that if there is any traction, then we would remain a data ownership and employee empowerment platform, which will dabble in online recruiting and online career management (SaaS). Doing it the other way around would make no sense - you cannot be a SaaS or HR tech company that dabbles in employee empowerment.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">
                What if there is traction but some other company does it better?
                Then employees/workers win even more. There are many SaaS and HR tech models which could be rebuilt this way.
