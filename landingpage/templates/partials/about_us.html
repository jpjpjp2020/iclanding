                ImpactCount is based on a simple idea.
                Employees get to own and leverage their positive reviews and endorsements,
                collected directly from clients and colleagues.
                And employers get to showcase the combined positive impact their team has on clients.
            </p>

            <p class="text-3xl mb-12">
                We believe that when employees control their own positive reviews and endorsements,
                it creates a win-win situation. It strengthens relationships and fosters a motivated work
                environment filled with meaning.
            </p>

                In short, it's about time we did things this way.
