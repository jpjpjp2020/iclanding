### ImpactCount

MVP/beta test for a platform where employees can collect and own their positive performance data (like reviews and endoresements).

#### Problem:

- Trying to solve employee motivation issues with intrusive and disingenuous incentives is the equivalent of organizing a pizza party instead of providing salary raises. 
- True employee empowerment should mean granting employees more control to improve their lives.

#### Possible solution to be validated:

- For companies, positive client reviews specifically mean more revenue. ImpactCount aims to validate if similar logic is true and useful to employees - collecting, owning, and leveraging their positive feedback and endorsements to their advantage, collected directly from clients and colleagues.
